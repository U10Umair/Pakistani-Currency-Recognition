# Day 03 – Image Preprocessing

## Objective
Understand and apply basic image preprocessing required before training a neural network.

## Work Done
- Loaded a sample image from the dataset
- Resized the image to a fixed size (224 × 224)
- Normalized pixel values from range [0, 255] to [0, 1]
- Verified image shape for CNN compatibility

## Why This Step Matters
Neural networks require:
- consistent image dimensions
- scaled pixel values for stable training

Before applying preprocessing to the entire dataset, the process was verified on a single image to ensure correctness.

## Outcome
Image preprocessing steps are understood and validated.  
The dataset is ready for batch processing in the next stage.
